    Classic Tile &amp; Cascade
</h1>
<p>
    Classic Tile &amp; Cascade was created to restore the following actions  to
    the taskbar in Windows 11:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Cascade windows
    </li>
    <li>
        Show the desktop
    </li>
    <li>
        Show windows side by side
    </li>
    <li>
        Show windows stacked
    </li>
    <li>
        Undo Minimize
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    These actions were available in Windows 10 and earlier  versions of Windows
    by right clicking any blank area on the toolbar and  selecting them from a
    context menu. This was removed in Windows 11 and users  were encouraged to
    use the alternative &quot;Aero Snap&quot; tiling features.
</p>
<p>
    Windows 10 also introduced a behavior (most  users would call it a &quot;bug&quot;)
    when choosing &quot;Show windows side by side&quot; or &quot;Show  windows stacked&quot; from
    the taskbar context menu whereby a blank space  was often left on the
    desktop. E.g., if there are two non-minimized windows,  stacking those 2
    Windows would only take up 2/3 of the desktop, with a blank  area left at
    the bottom of the desktop.
</p>
<p>
    By  default, Classic Tile &amp; Cascade uses a customized algorithm to
    choose the  windows to tile or cascade which avoids this behavior. E.g., if
    there are two  non-minimized windows, stacking those 2 Windows would result
    in each window  covering 1/2 of the desktop. The usually buggy default
    cascade/tile behavior carried  over from Windows 10 can be restored using
    the Settings menu.
