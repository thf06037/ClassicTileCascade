Classic Tile & Cascade uses the [log.c](https://github.com/rxi/log.c) open source library:

 I was guided by several blog entries from Raymond Chen's fantastic [oldnewthing blog](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/).
 Particularly helpful was the blog entry ["Which windows appear in the Alt+Tab list?,"](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20071008-00/?p=24863) 
 which helped me to develop the custom algorithm used for tiling and cascading windows 
 in the same way that these functions worked pre-Windows-10.
